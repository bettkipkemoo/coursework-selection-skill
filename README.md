Calls for course-selection requirements and procedures

## About
Registering for courses during spring is necessary , especially with the focus to implement a full time online registration. As the covid-19 continues to rampage the world, there is need to identify ways in which it can be sorted to faciltate learning. As such, coming up with a skill which will learn regular questions and address them appropriately will be very effective. This course-selection skill will be trained to achieve that.

## Examples
* "When is the deadline to register for spring semester?"
* "Which courses are offered in spring?"
* "How can I register for spring semester?"
* "Is computer programming offered in spring of 2021?"
* "What are the minimum requirements for new intakes?"
* "Which materials should be availed with oneself during intake?"
